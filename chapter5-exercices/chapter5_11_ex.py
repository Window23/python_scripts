""" (Word or Phrase to Phone-Number Generator)
    Just as people would enjoy knowing what word or phrase their phone number corresponds to,
    they might choose a word or phrase appropriate for their business and determine what phone numbers correspond to it.
    These are sometimes called vanity phone numbers, and various websites sell such phone numbers.
    Write a script similar to the one in the previous exercise that produces the possible phone number for the given seven-letter string. """
