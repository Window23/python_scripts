""" (Modified average Function)
    The average function we defined in Section 4.11 can receive any number of arguments.
    If you call it with no arguments, however, the function causes a ZeroDivisionError.
    Reimplement average to receive one required argument and the arbitrary argument list argument *args, and update its calculation accordingly.
    Test your function.
    The function will always require at least one argument, so youâ€™ll no longer be able to get a ZeroDivisionError.
    When you call average with no arguments, Python should issue a TypeError indicating "average() missing 1 required positional argument. """
